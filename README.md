# rusty-hall
I first wrote this little progam in Python, because Python is my go-to language for writing something quickly.
However, I quite enjoy Rust as a language, so I decided to implement my monty-hall pogram in it. I purposefully over-engineered
the Rust version, because it led to me exploring the language a bit. Also, it is sometimes tremendous fun to do things the
difficult way.
